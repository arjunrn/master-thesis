\chapter{Abstract}
ZooKeeper is distributed co-ordination service which has a multitude of uses in distributed systems. It is based on the ZAB protocol which ensures consistency and total-ordering of the data updates on all nodes. However this protocol is limited by overhead for quorum between the participant nodes. As the size of the cluster grows larger the overhead increases. But to support more connected clients through horizontal scaling we have to add more servers to the ZooKeeper cluster. We attempt to solve the quorum overhead problem by partitioning the namespace.
