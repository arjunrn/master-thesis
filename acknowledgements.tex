I would like to thank everyone who helped during every step of my thesis work, without whom this undertaking would not have been. I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Christof Fetzer and the Systems Engineering Chair for giving me this opportunity to work on scaling the throughput of ZooKeeper. My gratitude to all the members of the Systems Engineering Chair who provided feedback and criticism to improve my work.

Secondly I would like to thank my supervisor Dipl. Inf. Katja Tietze for her guidance and supervision along the way. Her guidance, support and encouragement throughout my thesis helped shaped it. She guideded me through every step of the process and pointed me in the right direction when I needed it.

And finally I would like to thank my parents and my friends in Dresden for their encouragement.
